# Medicare Provider Performance & Fraud Detection Analytics

**Project Overview**

Build a comprehensive analytics system to identify potentially fraudulent Medicare providers, predict healthcare costs, and analyze provider performance patterns using real CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) public data.

**Business Problem**

How can CMS identify high-risk providers for audit prioritization while optimizing healthcare spending and improving patient outcomes across Medicare programs?


**Public Datasets (All Free from CMS)**

Medicare Provider Utilization & Payment Data - 1M+ records of provider services and payments
Medicare Part D Prescriber Data - Prescription drug patterns by provider
Hospital Compare Data - Quality ratings and patient outcomes
Provider of Services File - Provider demographics and certifications
Geographic Variation Data - Regional healthcare spending patterns

**Technical Implementation**

**Phase 1: Healthcare Data Integration & Cleaning**

Merge multiple CMS datasets using provider NPIs (National Provider Identifiers)
Handle healthcare-specific data quality issues (missing procedure codes, duplicate claims)
Create provider profiles with services, specialties, patient volumes
Geographic mapping and demographic analysis

**Phase 2: Fraud Detection & Risk Scoring**

Anomaly detection using isolation forests and statistical outliers
Supervised learning for known fraud patterns
Network analysis of provider referral patterns
Time series analysis for unusual billing spikes
Risk scoring algorithm combining multiple fraud indicators

**Phase 3: Cost Prediction & Utilization Analysis**

Patient cost prediction using demographics, diagnoses, and provider characteristics
Resource utilization forecasting by specialty and region
Readmission risk modeling using hospital quality data
Drug spending analysis with Part D prescriber data

**Phase 4: Provider Performance Analytics**

Quality score modeling predicting hospital ratings
Comparative effectiveness analysis across providers
Geographic disparity analysis in care access and outcomes
Specialty-specific benchmarking and performance metrics


**Key Technical Components**

**Data Processing:**

python
#Healthcare-specific libraries
- pandas, numpy for data manipulation
- pyjanitor for healthcare data cleaning
- fuzzywuzzy for provider name matching
- geopandas for geographic analysis

**Machine Learning:**

python
# Fraud detection
- scikit-learn (Isolation Forest, Random Forest)
- pyod for outlier detection
- networkx for provider network analysis

# Prediction models

- folium for geographic mapping
- streamlit for dashboard deployment
- seaborn for statistical plots

**Expected Deliverables**

1. Fraud Detection System - Risk scores for 100k+ providers
2. Cost Prediction Model - Patient-level cost forecasting (RÂ² > 0.75)
3. Provider Performance Dashboard - Interactive quality metrics
4. Geographic Analysis - Regional healthcare disparity insights
5. Executive Report - Policy recommendations for CMS
